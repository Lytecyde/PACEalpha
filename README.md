phaser game of covert ops dealing with a nonviolent uprising using negotiation techniques, emotology,
social relationship networks.

it is a roguelite game, curious differences from the definition 
- with a band of characters the player can assume it is not 
- no mass killings, in fact you need to save lives and win their hearts
- 

The big plan:
Around 150 pages of sketches have been written so far.

Much more work lies ahead.

I want to use the ideas of 
Jim Camp and Chris Voss - negotiation
Jack Schafer - elicitation and empathy
Jonah Bergen - blocks against recruitment
Paul Ekman - emotology and lies
Janine Driver - Body Movement Analysis
Alan Watkins - stress and coherence 
and NVC - non violent communication



At this point it is just a demo with a couple of fun features.

1) in the install directory create a lib directory

mkdir lib 

2) download 
phaser.js or phaser.min.js 
from their website 

3) copy that to the lib directory

4) install serve with
npm install -g serve
5) open command linerun:
serve
