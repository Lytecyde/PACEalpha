# PACEalpha
phaser game of covert ops dealing with a nonviolent uprising using negotiation techniques, emotology,
social relationship networks.

it is a roguelite game, curious differences from the definition are
- with a band of characters the player can assume, it is not a single alter ego game. 
- no mass killings, in fact you need to save lives and win their hearts
- 

The big plan:
Around 150 pages of sketches have been written so far.

Much more work lies ahead.

I want to use the ideas of 
Jim Camp and Chris Voss - negotiation
Jack Schafer - elicitation and empathy
Jonah Bergen - blocks against recruitment
Paul Ekman - emotology and lies
Janine Driver - Body Movement Analysis
Alan Watkins - stress and coherence 
and NVC - non violent communication



At this point it is just a demo with a couple of fun features.
PLAN 

1) spies walk around now on their job paths
TODO:
1) both sides walk around
2) each agent completes secret missions and does "real" cover jobs in 
    (entertainment, finance, propaganda, forces) which provide resources as miice
3) does not matter who wins if one side loses the player loses
4) to win, pass agents and recruit them or stop them from completeing their jobs
